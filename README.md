# Vivian---Desktop-Voice-Assistant

This project is simple desktop voice assistant built with python named as “Vivian - Desktop Voice Assistant”. This project is fully completed and error free.
Please make sure you install  the required packages using the "requirements.txt" file (use "pip install -r  requirements.txt" to install the packages).

I also request you to make sure mic is working fine and you are in a quiet environment while executing as the assistant tends to keep listening if there is noise around.
